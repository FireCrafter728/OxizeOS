This includes all forms of sale, charge, or "discounted" transactions; distribution for any financial gain requires the author's explicit permission. Credit is appreciated but not required.

The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement.

Those seeking to distribute OxizeOS commercially must submit a request for review, providing the proposed source code. Permission will only be granted via a formal agreement signed by both parties, after the author reviews the proposed distribution and pricing. Copies of the agreement will be securely stored in both digital and printed form. After the agreement is granted, the author may request the current source code and pricing at any time with a minimum interval of six months, but cannot take any market share of that product. If a request is sent less than six months after the last one, the author must provide a valid reason; if no valid reason is provided, the redistributor has the right to ignore the request. If the agreement is discontinued—which may happen if the redistributor fails to provide the source code or pricing when requested within a valid reason or after six months from the last request—the redistributor must cease commercial redistribution and reapply for permission to distribute OxizeOS commercially.
